**Cardinality of a set** is the number of elements in the set.

The Cardinality of the set A is denoted by |A| = 2

### Power Set (P)

P(A) = { {⍺} , {β} , {⍺,β} , {ɸ} }

Power set of A denoted by P(A) is the set of all subsets of A.

# Laws of sets

## Commutativity

- It is about the order of certain mathematical operations
- E.g:
    - 2x3 = 3x2           //hence is commutative
    - 8+5 = 5+8         //hence is commutative
    - 5-2 ≠ 2-5          //hence is ********NOT********  commutative
- In sets,
    - Unions are commutative
        - A∪B = B∪A
    - Intersections are commutative
        - A∩B = B∩A
    - Symmetric differences are commutative
        - A⊕B = B⊕A
    - Set differences are ********NOT******** commutative
        - A-B ≠ B-A

## Distributivity

- Sometimes called the distributive law of multiplication and division
- Basically means multiplying the sum of set is the same as multiplying the set individually and adding the sum later and vice-versa for division
- E.g:
    - 3x(2+5) = 3x2 + 3x5    //hence is distributive
- Set unions are distributive over the set intersections
    - A∪(B∩C) = (A∪B)∩(A∪C)
- Set intersections are distributive over set unions
    - A∩(B∪C) = (A∪B)∪(A∩C)
    
    ## De Morgan’s Law
    
    De Morgan’s law describe how mathematical statements and concepts are related through their opposites
    
    - In set theory, De Morgan’s law relate to the ******************************intersection****************************** and ************union************ of sets through their complements
    - The rules are
        - (A∪B)’ = A’ ∩ B’
        - (A∩B)’ = A’ ∪ B’

# Partition of a set

Partition of a set is the subdivision of the object into parts, so that these parts are completely separated from each other, yet together they form the whole object

- Dis-joint sets
    - Two sets are disjoint if and only if A∩B = ∅     // this means A and B are mutually exclusive and do not intersect
- A partition of set A is a set of subsets, Ai, of A such that all the subsets, Ai, are dis-joints and the union of all subsets, Ai, is equal to set A

**Week 3 and Week 4**

# Proving questions

- There are 3 methods we can use for proving questions when it comes to sets
- They are:

## 1)Membership Tables

- It is a table that can show if a set is shaded or not, where 0 means not shaded and 1 means shaded
- Is used to show prove set equations
- for more info look at discrete math booklet

## 2)Formula method

- This is the most common method use
- Is using the formula and laws that we learnt before and using them to prove 2 equations as true

## 3) Pick a point method

- Pick a point method is used by proving that the 2 equations have the same elements
- For more info look at discrete math booklet

# Functions

**Definition: A function, f , from a set A to a set B is an assignment of exactly one element of B to                        each element of A** 

OR

************************************************************************************************************A mapping, f , that assigns each element of the domain (set of inputs) into the Co-domain (set of possible outputs) in such a way that every(all) element of the domain is mapped into a unique(exactly 1) element of the co-domain is called a function**

***********The range(Rf) is the set of all given outputs while the co-domain(Co-Df) is the set of all possible outputs.*

Rf ⊆ Co-Df

- ****A function is a rule that relates to how one quantity depends on other quantities
- A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs, in which each input maps to exactly 1 output
- A function is a well-behaved relation, that is, given a starting point, we know exactly where to go.
- Function is central to computer programming
- A function maps an element of a set to an element in another set
- E.g:
    - Let set A = { Sea, Land, Sky }  // this is the set containing the string of sea, land, sky
    - Let set B = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }   //this is the set containing integers from 1-6
    - A function can map the string to it’s corresponding number of characters:
        - Sea and Sky string from set A is mapped to 3 from Set B
        - Land string from set A is mapped to 4 from Set B
    - This is how a function works
    - The example can be written as f: A → B, and can be read as f maps A to B.
    - It can also be written as: x ∈ A : x → f(x) = y (y ∈ B)   //basically you are replacing x with A and y with B

## Terminology

- Given a function f: A → B, x ∈ A : x → f(x) = y (y ∈ B)
    - A is the set of inputs and is called the domain of f. We write it as Df=A
    - B is the set containing the outputs and is called the co-domain of f. We write it as Co-Df=b
    - The set of all outputs is called the range of f and it is written as Rf
    - y is called the image of x, whereas x is called the pre-image of y. We write this as f(x)=y
- Lets look at an example:
    - A = { On, Sea, Land, Sky }
    - Y = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
    - {On} → {2} , {Sea, Sky} → {3} , {Land} → 4
    - Df=A          //Set A is Df, the set that is mapping
    - Co-Df=B     //Set B is called Co-Df, the set that is mapped onto
    - Rf={2,3,4}    //this is basically the elements of B that maps with A
    - in {On}→{2}, 2 is the image of ‘On’ and ‘On’ is the pre-image of 2
    - f(On)=2 and Pre-images(2)={On}
    - f(Sea)= 3 , f(Sky)=3 and Pre-images(3)={Sea, Sky}

# Floor and Ceiling Functions

## Floor Function

- Will return the closest number that is on the left of the number line
- For example
    - f: **************R → Z**************
        - f(x)=⌊x⌋ , where ⌊x⌋ represents floor function of X
            - ⌊2.5⌋ = 2
            - ⌊-2.5⌋ = -3
            - ⌊0⌋ = 0
            - ⌊2⌋ = 2
            - ⌊-2⌋ = -2

## Ceiling Function

- Will return the closest number that is on the right of the number line
- f:************R→ Z************
    - f(x) = ⌈ x ⌉, where ⌈ x ⌉ represents ceiling function of x
        - ⌈ 2.5⌉ = 3
        - ⌈ -2.5 ⌉ = -2
        - ⌈ -2 ⌉ = -2
        - ⌈ 2 ⌉ = 2

# Plotting functions

## Linear functions

- A linear function is f(x)=ax+b
- if a>0, the function is increasing and vise-versa
- Is basically a line on the graph

## Quadratic functions

- f(x)=ax^2 + bx + c , and a 1≠0
- Is a quadratic line on a graph

## Exponential functions

- f(x)=b^x , where b>0 and b≠1
    - E.g:
        - f(x) = e^x
        - f(x) = a^x
- It is an exponential line on a graph

# Injective and surjective functions

## Injective function (one-to-one)

- Let f : A → B to be a function
    - f is said to be an *******************************injective(one-to-one) function******************************* if and only if
        - for all a,b **∈** A, if a ≠ b, then f(a) ≠ f(b)  which is the same as saying:
        - for all a,b **∈** A, if f(a) = f(b), then a = b
- ******BASICALLY, IF YOU DRAW A HORIZONTAL LINE [—] AND IT CUTS THE GRAPH EXACTLY ONCE, IT IS INJECTIVE! IF IT CUTS MORE THAN ONCE, IT IS NOT INJECTIVE**
- Proving a function is injective
    - Show that f:R→R with f(x)=2x+3 is an injection
        1. let a,b **∈** R, show that f(a)=f(b) then a=b
        2. suppose f(a) = f(b) → 2a+3 = 2b+3 → 2a=2b → a=b hence f is injective
        3. Or we can do it as:
        4. f(a) ≠ f(b) → 2a+3 ≠ 2b+3 → 2a≠2b → a≠b hence f is injective
        
    - E.g:
        - Show f(x) = x+1 is injective
        1. Suppose f(a) = f(b)
        2. a+1 = b+1
        3. a=b
        4. Thus, f is injective (one-to-one)
- Proving that a function is NOT injective
    - Show that f:R→R with f(x)=x^2 is not an injection
        1. prove that f(a) = f(b) when a≠b
        2. In this example, a=5 and b=-5
        3. f(5) = 5^2 = 25 
        4. f(-5) = (-5)^2 = 25
        5. Thus, f(5) = f(-5). However, 5 ≠ -5 thus is not an injection

## Surjective function (onto)

- let f : A → B be a function
    - f is said to be an **********************surjective(onto) function********************** if and only if
        - every element of the co-domain of f, B, has at least one pre-image int the domain of f, A
        - for all y **∈** B, there exist x **∈** A such that y=f(x)
        - If Rf = Co-Df, THEN SURJECTIVE . Usually, Rf ⊆ Co-Df
        - If Rf ≠ Co-Df, THEN NOT SURJECTIVE
    - ******BASICALLY, IF YOU DRAW A VERTICAL LINE [ | ] AND IT CUTS THE GRAPH EXACTLY ONCE, IT IS SURJECTIVE! IF IT CUTS MORE THAN ONCE, IT IS NOT SURJECTIVE**
    - Proving that a function is surjective
        - Show that f:R→R with f(x)=2x+3 is a surjective function
            1. Let y **∈** R, show that there exists x **∈** R such that f(x)=y
            2. f(x)=y → 2x+3=y → 2x=y-3 → x=(y-3)/2 **∈** R
            3. For any element of y, we can find the element of x to be a real number hence, showing that the function is surjective
            4. This also shows if you take element y in a co-domain, you can find element x in the domain such that y is an image of x
    - Proving that a function is NOT surjective
        - Show that f:R→R with f(x)=x^2 is not a surjective function

# Bijective(invertible) Function

********************************************************************************************Definition: A function is said to be bijective or invertible if and only if it is both injective and surjective********************************************************************************************

- If a function is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto), it is called a **********bijective (invertible)********** function

## Inverse Function

**********************Definition:**********************

****************Let f:A→B****************

****If f is bijective, then the inverse function exists and is defined as f^-1:B→A,****

![Untitled](Discrete%20Mathematics%20-%20CM1020%20-%20L10B%2084084ae206c2407994771008fd42959f/Untitled%2010.png)

$$
f: R \rightarrow R
$$

$$
f(x) = x+1\\y=x+1\\x=y-1
$$

$$
f:A \rightarrow B \\f^{-1}: B \rightarrow A
$$

# Functional Composition

- Given two function, f and g,
    - (f o g)(x) = f(g(x))
    - Basically, is a function within a function
    - E.g:
        - Find f o g given f(x)=2x and g(x)=x^2
            - f o g = f(g(x)) =f(x^2)=2x^2
    - Note that f o g ≠ g o f → function composition is NOT commutative

# Propositional Logic

******************************************************Definition: Propositional logic is the branch of logic interested in studying mathematical statements******************************************************

- Basically an algebra for propositions, except in this algebra, the variables are unknown propositions instead of unknown real numbers
- The operators used are: and, or, not, implies and if, and, only, if, rather, than, +, -, *, and divide

## Propositions

**************************Definition: A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both**************************

- A proposition is the most basic element of logic
- Can only exist as true or false and nothing else. Unknowns and perspectives cannot be propositions

## Propositional variable

- To avoid writing long and repetitive propositions, we use propositional variables
- A propositional variable is typically a letter, such as p, q, r,…

# Truth tables and Truth sets

## Truth Table

******Definition: A truth table is a tabular representation of all the possible combinations if its constituent variable******

- For example
    - Below are 2 propositional variables p and q
        
        
        |             p |            q |
        | --- | --- |
        | FALSE | FALSE |
        | FALSE | TRUE  |
        | TRUE | FALSE  |
        | TRUE | TRUE |
- To construct a truth table for n propositions, you need to
    - Create a table with 2^n rows and n columns
    - For example, if you want create a table for 3 propositions, you need 2^3 = 8 rows and 3 columns
- An example of truth table with 3 propositions, p, q, r
    
    
    |             p |            q |             r |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | F | F | F |
    | F | F | T |
    | F | T | F |
    | F | T | T |
    | T | F | F |
    | T | F | T |
    | T | T | F |
    | T | T | T |
- As you can see, there are 3 columns and 8 rows for 3 propositions

## Truth Set

**Definition: Let p be a proposition on a set S. The truth set of p is the set of elements of S for which p is true.**

- The truth set of a proposition will be in capital letters. i.e: In the above example, the truth set of proposition p will be P
- Example:
    - Let S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
    - let proposition p: n is even number
    - let proposition q:n is odd number
    - The truth set of p is written as P = {2,4,6,8,10}
    - The truth set of q is written as Q = {1,3,5,7,9}

# Compound Propositions

**************Definition: Compound propositions are statements built by combining multiple propositions using certain rules**

## Negation (¬)

- The negation of proposition p, denoted by ¬p, and read “not p”, is the statement: “It is not the case that p”
- The truth value of the negation of p, ¬p, is the opposite of the truth value of p
- Basically, ¬p is the opposite of p
- Example
    - p: “John’s program is written in Python”
    - ¬p: “John’s program is NOT written in Python”
    - Proposition p represented in a truth table below:
    
    |           p |          ¬p |
    | --- | --- |
    | F | T |
    | T | F |
- As seen in the truth table, ¬p will always be the opposite of p

## Conjunction (∧)

- The conjunction of proposition p and q, denoted by p∧q, is the proposition “p and q”
- The conjunction p∧q is only true when both p and q are true, and is false if this isn’t the case
- Basically, look at it as an “and” operator
- Example
    - p: “John’s program is written in Python”
    - q: “John’s program has less than 20 lines of code”
    - p∧q: “John’s program is written in Python AND has less than 20 lines of code”
    - The propositions and conjunctions written in a truth table below
    
    |          p |            q |           p∧q  |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | F | F | F |
    | F | T | F |
    | T | F | F |
    | T | T | T |

## Disjunction (∨)

- The disjunction of proposition p and q, denoted by p∨q, is the proposition “p or q”
- The disjunction p∨q is only false when both p and q are false, and is otherwise true
- Basically, look at it as an “or” operator
- Example
    - p: “John’s program is written in Python”
    - q: “John’s program has less than 20 lines of code”
    - p∨q: “John’s program is written in Python OR has less than 20 lines of code”
    - The proposition and disjunction written in a truth table below
        
        
        |          p |            q |           p∨q  |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | F | F | F |
        | F | T | F |
        | T | F | F |
        | T | T | T |

## Exclusive-or (**XOR, EOR, EXOR, ⊻ or ⊕)**

- The exclusive-or of p and q, denoted by p**⊕q,** is the proposition “p or q” (but not both)
- The exclusive-or p**⊕q** is true when p is true and q is false and when p is false and q is true
- Example
    - p: “John’s program is written in Python”
    - q: “John’s program has less than 20 lines of code”
    - p∨q: “John’s program is written in Python OR has less than 20 lines of code, but not both”

## Precedence of logical operations

- To build complex compound propositions we need to use parentheses
- Example
    - (p∨q)∧(¬r) is different from p∨(q∧¬r)
- To reduce  the number of parentheses, we can use the order of precedence
    
    
    | Operator | Precedence |
    | --- | --- |
    | ¬ | 1 |
    | ∧ | 2 |
    | ∨ | 3 |
- Example
- (p∨q)∧(¬r) can be written simply as p∨q∧¬r
    - This is because of the order of operations for propositions, where ¬ must be solved first followed by ∧ and lastly ∨

1) \; f(x)=e^x+5 \\y=e^x+5\\e^x=y-5\\x.ln.e = ln(y-5)\\x = ln(y)-ln(5)\\f^{-1}=ln(x-5)
$$

$$
2)g(x)=ln(x+2)+2\\y=ln(x+2)+2\\(y-2)=ln(x+2)\\log_e(x+2)=y-2\\x+2 = e^{y-2}-2\\g^{-1}(x)=e^{y-2}-2
$$

$$
3)h(x) = log_{2} (x-2)+3\\y = log_{2}(x-2)\\y-3=log_{2}(x-2)\\2^{y-3}= x-2\\x=2^{y-3}+2
$$

********Geometric Relations********

The function f(x) is symmetric to f’(x) on the line y = x 

**********************************************Composition of function**********************************************

$$
f(x)=x^2\\g(x)=x+3\\f\cdot g(x) = f(g(x))\\g \cdot f(x) = g(f(x))
$$

$$
let, \\f:A \rightarrow B \\g:B \rightarrow C
$$

Be two functions. Prove that if g.f is one to one then f must be one to one

Suppose f(a) =f(b) 

$$
where\\ a,b \in A
$$

$$
g[f(a)] = g[f(b)]
$$

and since g.f is a one to one function

$$
\therefore a = b\\ \therefore f \;is\;one-to-one
$$
