# Set Theory

## Basics of Sets

- **Set**: A collection of distinct elements.
- **Listing Method**: Representing sets by listing their elements.
- **Subset**: A set is a subset of another set if all its elements are in the other set.
- **Proper Set**: A set is a proper set if it is a subset of another set, but not equal to it.
- **Cardinality**: The number of elements in a set.
- **Power Set**: The set of all possible subsets of a given set.

## Special Sets

- **Natural Numbers (N)**: The set of positive integers.
- **Integers (Z)**: The set of positive and negative whole numbers.
  - **Positive Integers (Z^+)**: Positive whole numbers.
  - **Negative Integers (Z^-)**: Negative whole numbers.
  - **Non-Negative Integers (Z^+_0)**: Positive whole numbers including zero.
  - **Non-Positive Integers (Z^-_0)**: Negative whole numbers including zero.
- **Whole Numbers (W)**: Non-negative integers.
- **Rational Numbers (Q)**: Numbers expressible as a ratio of two integers.
- **Irrational Numbers (R\Q)**: Numbers not expressible as a ratio of two integers.
- **Real Numbers (R)**: All rational and irrational numbers.

## Rule of Inclusion (Set Builder Notation)

- Set builder notation: Describing sets using rules or conditions.

## Set Functions

- **Union (A ∪ B)**: Combines elements from two sets.
- **Intersection (A ∩ B)**: Contains common elements.
- **Complement (¬A, A', A^L)**: Contains elements not in the original set.
- **Set Difference (A - B, B - A)**: Contains elements in one set but not the other.
- **Symmetric Difference (A ⊕ B)**: Contains elements in either set but not both.

## Laws of Sets

- **Commutativity**: Order of set operations for union (∪) and intersection (∩).
- **Distributivity**: Interaction between union (∪) and intersection (∩).
- **De Morgan’s Law**: Relation between union (∪) and intersection (∩).
- **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: Calculates the size of the union of sets.
- **Partition of a Set**: Subdividing a set into mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive subsets.

## Proving Questions

- Three methods for proving questions related to sets: Membership Tables, Formula Method, and Pick a Point Method.

# Functions

## Definition of a Function

- **Function**: A rule that assigns one element from a set to another set. (f: A → B)
- **Domain (Df)**: Set of inputs.
- **Co-Domain (Co-Df)**: Set of possible outputs.
- **Range (Rf)**: Set of actual outputs.
- **Image**: Element in the co-domain corresponding to an element in the domain.

## Injective and Surjective Functions

- **Injective (One-to-One) Function**: No two different domain elements map to the same co-domain element.
- **Surjective (Onto) Function**: Every co-domain element has at least one pre-image in the domain.
- **Bijective (Invertible) Function**: Both injective and surjective.

## Inverse Function

- The inverse function of a bijective function undoes the operation of the original function.

## Functional Composition

- Combining two functions to create a new function.

# Propositional Logic

- **Proposition**: A declarative sentence that is either true or false.
- **Propositional Variable**: A letter representing a proposition.
- **Truth Table**: Tabular representation of all combinations of variables.
- **Truth Set**: Set of elements for which a proposition is true.

## Compound Propositions

- **Negation (¬)**: Represents the opposite of a proposition.
- **Conjunction (∧)**: Logical AND between two propositions.
- **Disjunction (∨)**: Logical OR between two propositions.
- **Implication (→)**: "if-then" logic.
- **Biconditional (↔)**: "if and only if" logic.

## Laws of Propositional Logic

- **Commutative Laws**: Interchangeable order for conjunction (∧) and disjunction (∨).
- **Associative Laws**: Change of grouping for conjunction (∧) and disjunction (∨).
- **Distributive Laws**: Interplay between conjunction (∧) and disjunction (∨).
- **Identity Laws**: The identity elements in conjunction (∧) and disjunction (∨).
- **Contradiction and Excluded Middle**: Special cases of compound propositions.
